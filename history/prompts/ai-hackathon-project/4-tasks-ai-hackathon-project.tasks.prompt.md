# Task Breakdown: AI-Driven Hackathon Project

## User Prompt

```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive task breakdown (tasks.md) for the AI-Driven Hackathon Project with 49 specific, actionable tasks organized across 5 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (7 tasks) - Project initialization and dependency setup
2. Phase 2: Foundational (7 tasks) - Core utilities and infrastructure
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automated Book Generation (10 tasks) - Spec-engine functionality
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Intelligent Book Querying (12 tasks) - RAG-backend functionality
5. Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (13 tasks) - Documentation, security, testing

Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs (T001-T049), parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2]. The breakdown includes proper dependency tracking, parallel execution examples, and independent test criteria for each user story.

## Outcome

The task breakdown is complete and ready for implementation. It provides a clear roadmap for developing the AI-Driven Hackathon Project with both the spec-engine for automated content generation and the RAG-backend for intelligent querying, while following the project's constitutional principles for code quality, documentation, error handling, and security.
