# Project: AI-Driven & Spec-Driven Hackathon

## Goal
Create a monolithic repository containing two integrated projects:
1. **book-ui**: A Docusaurus-based website hosting an AI-written book.
2. **rag-backend**: A FastAPI backend using OpenAI/Qdrant for RAG (Chat with Book).

## Architecture
- Root Directory
  - book-ui/ (Docusaurus)
  - rag-backend/ (FastAPI + Python)
  - spec-engine/ (Automation scripts)

## Constraints
- Code must be neat, clean, and follow Senior Developer standards.
- Use strict typing in TypeScript.
- Use Pydantic models in Python.
