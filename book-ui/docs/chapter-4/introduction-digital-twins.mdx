## Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that serve as real-time proxies for their physical counterparts. In robotics and manufacturing, digital twins play an increasingly important role in design, testing, optimization, and maintenance. This chapter explores the concept of digital twins and their applications in robotics.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system that spans its lifecycle. It is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning, and reasoning to help make decisions. The concept was first described by Dr. Michael Grieves at the University of Michigan in 2002 and has since evolved significantly.

### Key Characteristics of Digital Twins

- **Dynamic**: Continuously updated with real-time data from their physical counterparts
- **Connected**: Maintains a live connection to sensors on the physical system
- **Historical**: Provides historical context and trend analysis
- **Predictive**: Enables predictive modeling and forecasting
- **Authoritative**: Serves as the single source of truth for the system's state

## History and Evolution

The concept of digital twins has evolved from early computer-aided design (CAD) models and simulation tools. Key milestones include:

- **1960s-1970s**: Early simulation and modeling techniques
- **1980s-1990s**: Development of virtual prototyping
- **2000s**: Conceptualization of digital twin by Dr. Michael Grieves
- **2010s**: NASA's use of digital twins for spacecraft maintenance
- **2020s**: Mainstream adoption across industries
