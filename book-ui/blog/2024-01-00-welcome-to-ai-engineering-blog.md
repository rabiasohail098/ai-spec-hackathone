## About This Blog

This blog is part of the **AI-Driven Hackathon Project**, focusing on how modern engineering practices are being transformed by artificial intelligence. Here, you'll find articles covering:

- **Spec-Driven Development**: How to build systems by specifying what you want rather than how to implement it
- **AI Agents**: Understanding the difference between chatbots and autonomous AI systems
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation patterns with vector databases
- **Generative AI**: Understanding the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Future of Engineering**: How AI will transform software development

## What You'll Learn

Through our articles, you'll gain insights into:

- Practical applications of AI in everyday engineering tasks
- Architecture patterns like RAG that combine AI with traditional systems
- Best practices for working with Large Language Models
- How to design systems that leverage AI capabilities effectively

## Our Goal

Our goal is to help engineers navigate the transition to AI-assisted development, providing practical guidance on how to leverage these new tools and methodologies effectively. We believe the future of software engineering lies in human-AI collaboration, where AI handles routine tasks while humans focus on creativity, strategy, and quality assurance.
